# SCRABBLE14

The Scrabble Project was part of my bachelor studies. The project was created in a group of 5 in my 4th semester and took around 2 months to complete. Around 25% of the code lines were written by me. Those are mostly part of the backend.basic, backend.network classes as well as tests and a bit of everything else.

The basic classes implement most of the game rules and functionality, as well as the representation of game states.

Skills portrayed:

- large projects
- Java (advanced)
- networks
- server
- interfaces in Java
- documentation
